Ever have instances of ruminating on a really interesting fact that you have just read about, heard from a touching song, watched from a video or a random insight about an idea that just popped in your mind, after the ‘aha’ moment that fires up your mind to make you feel like you are the genius in the room and immediately, compulsively want to disseminate; give a lecture about it and express your momentary professorship. But then… you keep it zipped, never to be heard of. It echoes against the walls of your cranium until it dies down. The profundity of the thought cut short…and then…it’s another shallow, kind of ‘shower thought’. Why? Because; probably you have other things to do and feel like it’ll be a waste of time; or nobody will care listening as they are all enjoying their shallow small talk; or maybe you lack the necessary communication skills and nobody ever takes you seriously because you’ve never delivered a good story, especially one that climaxes with a punchline. In other words, people are tired of your bland stories that lead to nothing; or because you lack in other good communication skills; or you’ve been again distracted by a pop up or notification from your post…etc.  And life moves on without ever reaching the bottom of any single idea or thought. Your mind is filled with superficial perceptions of things, all of them, and thus you live a life of mere belief; as, certainty is for knowers, especially the experienced, deep thinkers and deep researchers.

<p>
The phrase 'certainty is for knowers' above reminds me of the movie line: 
</p>
<p>
“Coffee is for closers” 
</p>
<p>
Deliverd by actor Alec Baldwin in Glengarry Glenross
</p>

This unsettling feeling of half-knowing is what inspired me to take a few YouTube lessons to learn and write the code of the website on which you are reading this from. In this world of mass-er distraction than ever precedented in history, people are tending to be more of half-thinkers and thus, half-knowers. Modernity has made life so easy that a person can live a long good life while being a complete half-knower for the rest of their life. Without ever doing anything profound but rather surfing the waves of mediocrity blissfully. On this page I have undertaken the task of journeying with you to the depths of those random thoughts in a quest for certainty. Complete certainty is however not guaranteed and especially on topics that remain a baffle since time immemorial and hitherto. Otherwise, we might find that for such, uncertainty will be the certainty we can find. We will however have enjoyed the views of the different dimensions that prove to us the certain uncertainty. However, as humans we have tried to make sense of most of the observable world around us through theories that have certainly proved to work and thus made inventions that exhibit great efficiency consistently. We will go through such especially. All the variety of the domains to be tackled is clearly stated I the about page.

On this page, I will provide the necessary connections to the right sources of information for complete self-study of the reader, viewer or listener as both text and especially multimedia will be used. Comments will always be open for better user experience and suggestions for the content.
